<h1> Introduction</h1>

<p>This application is designed to help users manage the care of their plants. Users can register each plant, view relevant information, and receive reminders for tasks such as watering, pruning, and other maintenance activities.</p>

<p>The application includes authentication via Supabase. There are two types of roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User:</strong> can view plants and their care tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrator:</strong> has permissions to create, modify, view, and delete plants and tasks. Additionally, the administrator can add new plant species to the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each plant includes detailed information such as common name, scientific name, family or species, type of plant (vegetable or fruit), size, and distinctive features. To make searching easier, users can apply filters by species or type of plant.</p>
